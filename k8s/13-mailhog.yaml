DEPRECATED: MailHog k8s manifest

This file previously deployed MailHog to the cluster for local SMTP
capture during development. The project has moved to using Office365
or a production SMTP provider; MailHog is no longer deployed by default.

If you need MailHog for local testing, re-create a manifest or restore
an older version from git history. Do NOT apply this file to production.
